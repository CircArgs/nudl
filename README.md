# nudl
poc cuda in pure nim
Inspired by https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/3171

# Building the example
There is `./src/cuda.nim` which uses `nudl` and `nimcuda` to make a simple function that squares a vector. To build it
use the `build` script in the root of the repo. It shows how nim can call `nudlcc` - a thin wrapper over `nvcc` that preprocesses the C files generated by Nim before handing them to `nvcc`.
Ensure you have cuda installed (check that you can call `nvcc`). Tested in the dockerfile as well as `nvcc 11.7` on Manjaro 21.3.7

# Current oddities
Depending on the Nim flags, `nvcc` may see incompatible flags. Currently, these are ignored and warned about.
